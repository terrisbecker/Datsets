# Datsets
All of my personal datasets. Data collected by myself and is free to use. 

## 100dicerolls.txt
A dataset containing 100 rolls of 6 different dice. Each column corresponds to one of the die and is labeled 'd' followed by the number
of sides (ex. d6 for six sided die). Hoping to add coin flips soon.  

## arrival-times.csv
A dataset containing the arrival times of 62 cars at an In-n-Out drive through in north San Jose. Observations were collected within a
1 hour window. The timestamp of each arrival was recorded once a vehicle came to a full stop in line at the drive through.
